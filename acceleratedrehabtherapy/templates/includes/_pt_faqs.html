            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Q: What should I wear to my first appointment?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">A: Ideally, you should wear loose clothing that will allow the therapist to assess and treat your injury. For example, if you are seeing a therapist for a shoulder injury, you may want to wear a tank top or shirt that can be easily pulled up over your head. You should also avoid wearing jewelry, as it may get in the way or be damaged.</p>
