                        With the best physical therapy, you can overcome just about anything. Especially when it comes to advanced physical therapy, a trained professional can help people with a broad range of physical challenges. Along with reducing or eliminating auto accident pain (which can be further addressed with our <a href="{% url 'main:chiropractor' %}" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">specialized chiropractic treatments</a>), this is an excellent way to improve mobility. This type of therapy is often used to deal with the more challenging problems, and it yields outstanding results. Best of all, this often helps people avoid surgery.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        For example, if someone's in a car accident that results in badly broken bones, there's a good chance of that person needing surgery. However, there are also cases in which an individual can avoid surgery by going to advanced physical therapy. Most reputable medical doctors will do everything possible to keep a person out of the operating room. A big part of that involves sending them to physical therapy at a trusted clinic.

                        WHAT ARE THE MAIN BENEFITS OF<br>PROFESSIONAL PHYSICAL THERAPY?

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Professional physical therapy offers many excellent benefits in addition to easing pain associated with a work injury or auto injury. As mentioned, this is a great way to improve mobility. Our physical therapy services can be combined with <a href="{% url 'main:chiropractor' %}" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">chiropractic care</a> for enhanced results. We also offer <a href="{% url 'main:massage' %}" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">therapeutic massage</a> to complement your treatment plan. Professional physical therapy improves balance for individuals who tend to fall, helps with managing vascular conditions and diabetes, and can make it easier for a stroke patient to recover.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Considering everything this type of rehab does, you might automatically think of physical therapy cost as out of reach. Fortunately, most insurance companies cover treatments. The right clinic will help with a workman's comp claim if applicable. While dealing with the work comp issue, you can focus on achieving optimal health and wellness.
                    </p>
