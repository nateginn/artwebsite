                        According to the National Safety Council, there are over 12 million motor vehicle accidents that involve more than 20 million vehicles each year. Choosing a <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">doctor for chiropractic</a> care after a car accident is a wise choice, especially because soft tissue injuries are some of the most common after a car accident. A car accident chiropractor can help individuals heal from an injury such as whiplash, which is common even in minor auto accidents.

                        An auto injury doctor can help you recover from problems like muscle and ligament sprains. After a car accident, chiropractic care is the method of choice for many people. The auto injury doctor can help you get work injury compensation. Without proper documentation from a medical professional soon after the accident, it is often very difficult to get workers' comp.

                        After being involved in a car accident, you should immediately schedule an appointment with an auto accident injury chiropractor. Even if you feel okay, it is still important to get checked out by a chiropractor after a car accident. It is possible that you may have sustained injuries that do not show symptoms right away.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The longer you delay treatment, the more likely you are to suffer from lasting injuries. Getting car accident physical therapy can help you regain function in your muscles. Many times, putting off treatment results in chronic pain for many years.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Another reason to see a chiropractor after a car accident is to document any injuries while you still have them. This will be important for insurance purposes later. If you do not obtain documentation, you may not receive compensation for rehab bills or workers' comp. An automobile injury chiropractic practice can give you the evaluation that you need for your car crash pain.

                <p class="text-gray-700">A: In Colorado your personal Auto insurance typically has "MEDPAY" that will cover a limited amount of your care. The party who is "at-fault" should also be responsible for some of your medical bills, if not all. If these options aren't available, we can often use your personal commercial insurance to cover your care, which will depend on the plan coverage.</p>
