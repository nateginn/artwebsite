                        There are several types of workplace injuries. In some cases, an individual sustains only minor bumps and bruises. Other times, work-related injuries are life-threatening. For more serious issues, it's not uncommon for physicians to refer patients to a <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Doctor of Chiropractic</a>. For many years, this was taboo. Today, most physicians recognize the value of chiropractic care.

                        At Accelerated Rehab Therapy, we offer four distinct types of rehabilitation, namely, chiropractic care, physical therapy, therapeutic massage, and nutrition counseling. Our No. 1 goal, regardless of the type of work comp injury, is to help patients achieve a full recovery in the fastest time possible.

                        Along with chiropractic care, physical therapy, and other treatment options for workers' comp injuries, we address problems that have nothing to do with the job. For instance, our skilled team at Accelerated Rehab Therapy sees a lot of patients with an auto injury. For that reason, we have an actual auto accident plan that streamlines the treatment and billing processes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        We also specialize in work injury cases. Our licenced specialist has seen just about everything. We understand that workers' comp injuries can sometimes pose challenges. Obviously, the patient needs rehabilitation as quickly as possible, but that can mean fighting with the insurance provider.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        For workers' comp chiropractic care, our goal is to provide patients with the care they need, but at the same time, we de-escalate stress that comes from dealing with the insurance company. If you've suffered from an injury that happened at work, contact us at Accelerated Rehab Therapy today by calling (970) 324-1750.
